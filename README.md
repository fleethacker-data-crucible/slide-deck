# Data Crucible judges brief (slide deck)

This repository holds the slide deck and its GitHub Pages site. The infographic slide deck that positions the whole Data Crucible suite against the six Fleethacker Norfolk use cases, for the judges. 23 slides, 16:9. Built 5 November 2026 from the comms win plan (1 November re-grade), the heavy-lift and consolidation proposals, the Fleet Relationship Map, Crow's Nest scoring, bridge-warden's event rules and evaluation report, PacketRat's path-to-fleet and human-authority pages, the 3 November ATO assessment, the 4 November 30/60/90 roadmap, and the demo videos in this repository.

**Live deck (present, comment, export to PowerPoint or PDF):** https://claude.ai/artifact/Lwb5XJrtcbxRRPyZTvRgmZ (private until shared from its Share menu).

## What is here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `export/Data-Crucible-Judges-Brief.pptx` | PowerPoint: one picture per slide, speaker notes, and the demo clips embedded as playable movies where they sit on the slide. |
| `export/Data-Crucible-Judges-Brief.pdf` | PDF of the 23 slides (clips show their poster frame). |
| `index.html` | The GitHub Pages site: the same viewer as `judges-brief.html`, at the repo root so `https://fleethacker-data-crucible.github.io/slide-deck/` opens the deck once Pages is enabled (Settings, Pages, Deploy from a branch, `main`, `/ (root)`). |
| `SUBMISSION-DESCRIPTION.md` | Paste-ready Project Description for the event portal. |
| `judges-brief.html` | Self-contained viewer: all 23 slides, scaled to the window, videos playable. Download it with the `assets/` folder beside it and open it in a browser; GitHub shows only its source. |
| `SPEAKER-NOTES.md` | The speaker notes, one entry per slide. |
| `deck.json` | The slide order, sections and typefaces (Exo 2 and IBM Plex Sans, from Google Fonts). |
| `slides/<id>.html` | One file per slide in the Slides artifact format: a single `<section>` with inline styles, the notes in a trailing `<aside>`. Asset references are relative paths into `assets/`. |
| `assets/emblems/` | The repo emblems and the Data Crucible emblem, downscaled to 420 px. |
| `assets/clips/` | 720p excerpts of the demo videos: the full pitch (1:40) and opening scene (0:37), and the first 40 seconds of each of the 16 tool demos, with a poster frame each. The full demos are in the `*-demo/video/` folders. |

## Status labels

Every use-case slide marks what was live before 4 November and what is event work, per Rule 7. The rubric totals and the Definition of Done counts are the win plan's own estimates from the 1 November re-grade and are labeled as estimates on the slides. Crow's Nest verdicts are the 28 October offline snapshot; its matching is keyword overlap.

## Rebuilding

The slides were authored by hand in the Slides artifact format and copied here with `/_blob/<id>` references rewritten to `assets/` paths. The clips were cut with ffmpeg: `-t 40 -vf scale=1280:-2 -c:v libx264 -crf 27 -c:a aac -b:a 64k -ac 1`, poster frame at 6 seconds.
